Global spending on AI is projected to reach nearly $1.5 trillion this year, and it could top $2 trillion in 2026. Joining us right now is one of, if not the key player that's been driving innovation in the field, Jensen Wong, he is the CEO of Nvidia. It's got a market cap of $4.5 trillion. Makes it the world's most valuable company. And Jensen, it is a pleasure to have you here on set. >> So happy to be here. Nice to see you. >> As happy as we are. Thank you for coming in today. It's great to see you. Thank you. There are so many things that I'd like to talk to you about, because it seems like every day there is this huge fire hydrant of news that's all about AI, and your company is at the center of most of that news. So if you don't mind, maybe we can just run through some of these headlines and you can explain what's happening from your perspective. >> I'd love to. >> Okay, let's start with the deal that you cut first with OpenAI that you've talked a lot about. That was then followed up by this deal earlier this week with AMD and OpenAI. It's got a lot of people trying to figure out what the dynamics are of this industry. What do you think about it? Did you know about that deal before it was announced? >> Not not really, but our deal is very different than theirs. We've been working with OpenAI through Azure, Microsoft and OCI and core. We've and so through third parties for quite a long time. In fact, in 2016, OpenAI that you've talked a lot about. That was then followed up by this deal earlier this week with AMD and OpenAI. It's got a lot of people trying to figure out what the dynamics are of this industry. What do you think about it? Did you know about that deal before it was announced? >> Not not really, but our deal is very different than theirs. We've been working with OpenAI through Azure, Microsoft and OCI and core. We've and so through third parties for quite a long time. In fact, in 2016, I delivered the world's very first AI supercomputer called DGX one, to a startup, a nonprofit startup in San Francisco. And that company turned out to have been OpenAI. And so we've been working with them for quite a long time. The OpenAI partnership is an addition to what we're already doing with them on the cloud, all of the cloud contracts. We're going to continue to execute on all that. But our partnership with them is quite unique in the sense that this is the first time we're going to sell directly to them. Until then. Until now, we've been largely selling. We're only selling through the clouds, and so we're going to keep doing that. But the thing that's really exciting is that now, by selling directly to them, we can help prepare them for a day when they're self-hosted, hyperscaler. And our agreement basically entails us selling entire systems and infrastructure to them. You know, we're the only company in the world today that really focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure, from CPUs to GPUs to networking chips and switches of all kinds and all the software stacks that go along with that. And so we're quite a unique partner for them to be able to do this.
